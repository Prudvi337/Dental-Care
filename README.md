## Technical Decisions

- **No backend**: All data is simulated and persisted in localStorage.
- **No external auth/data libraries**: Authentication and data management are fully custom.
- **TypeScript**: Ensures type safety and maintainability.
- **Context API**: Chosen for simple, scalable state management.
- **TailwindCSS**: Enables rapid, consistent, and responsive UI development.
- **Reusable Components**: UI and logic are modular for scalability and maintainability.

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

- Data is not shared across browsers/devices (localStorage only).
- No real backend or API integration.
- File uploads are stored as base64/blob URLs, not actual files.
- No password reset or user registration (hardcoded users only).
- Minimal accessibility testing (can be improved).
